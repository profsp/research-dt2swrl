This code refers to a new python module that is a proof of concept capable of integrating ontologies and decision trees. The module is part of a research project at OTH Amberg-Weiden and still under development. The core functionality has been positively tested against two heterogneous data sets from Kaggle to verify the flexibility. 

The associated research article is called "Towards Hybrid Self-Learning Ontologies: A New Python Module for Closed-Loop Integration of Decision Trees and OWL" and will be published soon. 

Further application tests and constructive feedback from the community is welcome.
